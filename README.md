**According to the chart describing user shopping behavior, users purchase the most in Novembe**r. This may be due to a number of factors, such as:

End-of-year holidays: November is the time for end-of-year holidays such as Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Christmas, New Year's Day, etc. This is the time when users often shop more to prepare for these occasions.
Discounts: Businesses often launch discount programs at the end of the year to stimulate consumption. This also makes users more likely to shop more.
Economic growth: Economic growth will make users have more money to spend, including shopping.
Choosing technology to meet user shopping needs

From the above analysis, it can be seen that user shopping behavior tends to increase at the end of the year. Therefore, businesses need to choose the right technology to meet the needs of users during this time.

Some factors to consider when choosing technology include:

Scalability: The technology needs to be scalable to meet the increasing demand for shopping in a short period of time.
Big data processing capabilities: The technology needs to have the ability to process large amounts of data from shopping transactions.
Security: The technology needs to ensure the security of user information, especially in online transactions.

Angular and ASP.NET WEB API is the best choice.
